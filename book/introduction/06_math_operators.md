# Math Operators

## Getting Started
If you worked on the last exercise, you probably noticed something. If we have two strings, such as
this in IRB

### Sidenote On Notation
In case there has been any confusion, there are some simple notations we will use for code blocks
and the input/output/editing ruby files pieces of all of this.

Any line starting with `$` is a terminal command. Such as:

`$ atom some_file.rb`
This opens atom with a file named `some_file.rb` from the terminal

`$ irb`
This opens up IRB in the terminal for an interactive session.

Anytime you see a larger block such as this:

```ruby
def foo(bar)
  print bar + " pants"
end
```

`some_file.rb`

The `some_file.rb` is the name of the file you will find corresponding in the `code_examples` section,
and also is a link to that specific code if clicked.

`$ irb`

```ruby
a = "hey "
b = "duder."
puts a + b

# => "hey duder."
nil
```
