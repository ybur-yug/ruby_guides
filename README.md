# Hello

## Introduction
If you're here, you probably are only here for one reason: You want to learn Ruby.

Good news! Ruby is about as friendly as programming languages get. It reads close enough to english
that even my mother can understand what well-written pieces of my code are doing, and she has a
tenuous grasp on 'computers and computing' as a whole.

The goal of this book is to be so completely self-contained that you can successfully build the
webpage you are viewing it on from scratch, and have a variety of options to do with. This is a lofty
goal, and it is far from it now. I promise you I will get there though :).


## Some Ruby

```ruby
puts "Hello, world."
```

This is the simplest Ruby program you can write. If this seems appealing, you are in for a great
ride. This series of guides and tutorials has several parts, accessible from someone with 0 Ruby
experience, to someone who is intermediate and wants to learn advanced techniques, or even for
a developer who is familiar with another language and/or framework and wants to make the dive in.

These guides only cover Linux and OSX setups for Ruby due to the rocky nature of handling Ruby code
on Windows.

However, we provide complete solutions for Windows users that utilize free software to
get the environment running as we have it here.
